# laminas-barcode

[![Build Status](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-barcode/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-barcode/actions?query=workflow%3A"Continuous+Integration")

`Laminas\Barcode` provides a generic way to generate barcodes. The `Laminas\Barcode`
component is divided into two subcomponents: barcode objects and renderers.
Objects allow you to create barcodes independently of the renderer. Renderer
allow you to draw barcodes based on the support required.
